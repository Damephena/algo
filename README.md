# Algo repository    
Contains all attempted algorithm and data structure questions.  
Some files may contain more than one solution whose efficiency may vary.   

- ### Sumup.py    
Attemps to solve the question:
> Given a list of numbers and a number `k`, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to `k`.   
> For example, given `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and `k` of `17`, return `true` since `10 + 7` is `17`.    

- ### Movezeros.py    
Attemps to solve the question:    
> Given a list, write a function to move all 0's to the end of the list while maintaining the relative order    
> of the non-zero elements.      
For example:    
> Input: `[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`    
> Output: `[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`     

- ### Listproduct.py    
Attemps to solve the question:    
> Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the  
> product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.   
For example:    
> Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`    
> Output: `[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]`    
> Input: `[3, 2, 1]`    
> Output: `[2, 3, 6]`    

- ### Lowestpositive.py    
Attemps to solve the question:    
> Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space.    
> In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array.   
For example:    
> Input: `[3, 4, -1, 1]`    
> Output: `2`    
> Input: `[1, 2, 0]`    
> Output: `3`
