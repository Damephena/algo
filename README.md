# Algo repository    
Contains all attempted algorithm and data structure questions.  
Some files may contain more than one solution whose efficiency may vary.   

- ### Sumup.py    
Attemps to solve the question:
> Given a list of numbers and a number `k`, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to `k`.   
> For example, given `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and `k` of `17`, return `true` since `10 + 7` is `17`.    

- ### Movezeros.py    
Attemps to solve the question:    
> Given a list, write a function to move all 0's to the end of the list while maintaining the relative order    
> of the non-zero elements.      
For example:    
> Input: `[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`    
> Output: `[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`
